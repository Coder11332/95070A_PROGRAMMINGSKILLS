There are three main files that we use.
The first two files (motorsetup.h and autonfunctions.h) are in the 'include' folder. These two files are where we set up the ports of all our motors, and wrote all the functions we use in our autonomous.
The third file (main.cpp) is in the 'src' folder. In main.cpp, we call our functions and input values to accomplish our autonomous.
